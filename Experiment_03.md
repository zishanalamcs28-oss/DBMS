## Experiment 3 – Advanced Retrieval Queries
# Aim:- To perform advanced filtering, pattern matching, ordering, and salary calculations using the employee table.

# Query 1:- List all employees and jobs in Department 30 in descending order by salary.
```sql
SELECT ename, job, sal
FROM employee
WHERE deptno = 30
ORDER BY sal DESC;
```
# Query 2:- List job and department number of employees whose name are five letters long beginning with 'A' and ending with 'N'.
```sql
SELECT job, deptno
FROM employee
WHERE ename LIKE 'A___N';
```
# Query 3:- Display the name of employees whose name starts with alphabet S.
```sql
SELECT ename
FROM employee
WHERE ename LIKE 'S%';
```
# Query 4:- Display the names of employees whose name ends with alphabet S.
```sql
SELECT ename
FROM employee
WHERE ename LIKE '%S';
```
# Query 5:- Display the names of employees working in department 10 or 20 or 40 or working as clerk, salesman or analyst.
```sql
SELECT ename
FROM employee
WHERE deptno IN (10, 20, 40)
OR job IN ('CLERK', 'SALESMAN', 'ANALYST');
```
# Query 6:- Display employee number and names for employees who earn commission.
```sql
SELECT empno, ename
FROM employee
WHERE comm IS NOT NULL
AND comm > 0;
```
# Query 7:- Display employee number and total salary for each employee.
```sql
SELECT empno, (sal + IFNULL(comm,0)) AS total_salary
FROM employee;
```
# Query 8:- Display employee number and annual salary for each employee.
```sql
SELECT empno, sal * 12 AS annual_salary
FROM employee;
```
# Query 9:- Display the names of all employees working as clerks and drawing a salary more than 3000.
```sql
SELECT ename
FROM employee
WHERE job = 'CLERK'
AND sal > 3000;
```
# Query 10:- Display the names of employees who are working as clerk, salesman or analyst and drawing a salary more than 3000.
```sql
SELECT ename
FROM employee
WHERE job IN ('CLERK', 'SALESMAN', 'ANALYST')
AND sal > 3000;
```
